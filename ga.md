ga
==
From https://github.com/rsp/scripts

Usage: `ga file [file ...]`

Source: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rsp/scripts/ga

Runs: `git add file [file ...]`

Nothing special, just less typying.
It can be made as an alias but sometimes scripts are more convenient to copy
and use without needing to change .bashrc or .profile

Advantage: less typing for fast operations.

Disadvantage: no smart command completion.
