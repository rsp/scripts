gcm

From https://github.com/rsp/scripts

Usage: `gcm your message` (no quoting of the commit message needed)

Source: https://rawgit.com/rsp/scripts/master/gcm

Runs: `git commit message -m ...`

The commit message is composed from all command line arguments
(you don't have to quote them).

So running: `gcm your message`
is equivalent to: `git commit -m "your message"`
