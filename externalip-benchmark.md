Find what services providing external IP address via http and https are the fastest.

The results were used to tune the [externalip](externalip.md) script
and to recommend good methods in this answer on Stack Exchange:

* [How can I get my external IP address in bash?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/22615/how-can-i-get-my-external-ip-address-in-bash/194136#194136)

## Results of experiments

### The fastest method using DNS:
```
dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
```

### The fastest using HTTP:
```
curl -s http://whatismyip.akamai.com/
```
Not always **the** fastest, but consistently very fast.

### The fastest using HTTPS:
```
curl -s https://4.ifcfg.me/
```
Some were faster but with invalid certificates.

### Using telnet via nc:
```
nc 4.ifcfg.me 23 | grep IPv4 | cut -d' ' -f4
```

### Using telnet via telnet:
```
telnet 4.ifcfg.me 2>&1 | grep IPv4 | cut -d' ' -f4
```

Those commands are run by [externalip](externalip.md) invoked with the following arguments:

	externalip dns
	externalip http
	externalip https
	externalip telnet
	externalip ftp

Currently `externalip telnet` uses `nc` for the connection.

There are a lot of options of different servers providing the external IP especially via HTTP.
I made those benchmarks to see if any of them are better than the others and I was surprised by the results.
E.g. one of the most widely recommended ifconfig.me was almost always the slowest for me, sometimes taking many seconds to respond. Many don't work over HTTPS. Some have invalid certificates.

You can run it yourself to see which services mentioned here are worth using:

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsp/scripts/master/externalip-benchmark
    chmod a+x externalip-benchmark
    ./externalip-benchmark
