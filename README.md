Random shell scripts for different tasks,
written mostly for answers on Stack Overflow:
<br/>
[![Follow on Stack Exchange][stackexchange-img]][stackoverflow-url]

Examples
--------
Some common command shortcuts for Git et al.:

* [`auu`](#auu) - apt-get update and upgrade for Debian or Ubuntu
* [`ga`](#ga) - git add
* [`gcm`](#gcm) - git commit with message quoted automatically
* [`gpod`](#gpod) - git push origin develop (with/without tags)
* [`gpom`](#gpom) - git push origin master (with/without tags)

Some other tools and commands:

* [`internalip`](#internalip) - get your internal IP address
* [`externalip`](#externalip) - get your external IP address
* [`sound`](#ok-functions) - play a sound a wait to finish
* [`soundbg`](#ok-functions) - play a sound in background
* [`sn1`](#ok-functions)/[`sn2`](#ok-functions)/[`sn3`](#ok-functions) - good sounds for notifications
* [`ok`](#ok-functions) - prints OK/ERROR if the last command succeeded/failed
* [`oks`](#ok-functions) - like `ok` but with different sounds played on success/failure

Details
-------
Those commands are
mostly for Linux but I would like them to work on as many
systems as possible - certainly on all POSIX systems.
If anything doesn't work, please post an [issue](#issues).

Work in progress - more to come. See:

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Issues](#issues)
* [Author](#author)
* [License](#license)

Some of those scripts were written for
[my answers on Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/303952/rsp):

* [Make a sound once process is complete](https://askubuntu.com/questions/277215/make-a-sound-once-process-is-complete/604116#604116) (on [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/users/11582/rsp))
* [How can I get my external IP address in bash?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/22615/how-can-i-get-my-external-ip-address-in-bash/194136#194136) (on [Unix & Linux](https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/23774/rsp))
* [How do I find my internal ip address?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/430853/how-do-i-find-my-internal-ip-address/604691#604691) (on [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/users/11582/rsp))
Some are just for my own conveniece. Maybe they would be useful to someone else.

Functions
---------
### `ok-functions`
Usage:
```
sn1
sn2
sn3
ok
oks
```

For example to hear when a long-running command finishes and to hear a different sound on success and on failure:

Example with success:
```
ls / && ls /bin && ls /usr; oks
```
example with error:
```
ls / && ls /bim && ls /usr; oks
```

Installation
------------
Most of those scripts should be stand-alone and can be copied in any place.
Those commands describes as functions need to be installed differently,
see below.

### Installing scripts
My recommendation is to make a `~/bin` or `~/scripts` directory:
```sh
mkdir ~/bin
```
and put this in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`:
```
[ -d "$HOME/bin" ] && PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```
That way it's easy to put any script there:
```sh
cd ~/bin
wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rsp/scripts/example
less example # see what was downloaded
chmod a+x example
```
And use it at will.
Of course always see what was downloaded first.

### Installing functions
Those commands described as functions need to be sourced to work,
either manually or in a file like `.profile`, `.bashrc` etc.

They don't have to be in your PATH and they don't have to be executable.
You can download them whenever you want, for example in your $HOME directory:
```sh
cd ~
wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/rsp/scripts/example-functions
less example-functions # see what was downloaded
```
Now you source them with `.` (dot) or `source` command:
```sh
. example-functions
```
If you put the sourcing line in your `.profile` or `.bashrc` they will be
available after all logins.
